## Work covered:

 * Create 9 jails with hostnames like jail<NN> where NN is a value 00 - 08
 * Create student00 user on each host
 * Create hosts file on each vhost (including localhost)
 * Create hosts file on each vhost (including localhost)



## Bonus Challenges:

 * make one jail and clone it (using fabric)
 * figure out how to move past errors in execution tasks
 * find out what autostart does
 * find out how to turn it on/off (using fabric)
 * put together a meta command that combines all of the tasks in order
